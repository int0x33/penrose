# Penrose Overview

For more information on any of the items summarized below, please use the navigation.

Penrose effortlessly creates beautiful diagrams using a 'trio':
 - A **Domain-specific Language (.dsl) program**.  
   This describes the __domain__ in which the diagram is defined.  I.e., Euclidian geometry, Set theory, etc.  Penrose supports a large and growing set of domains.  And if you don't see the domain you need, you can create one yourself.
 - A **Substance (.sub) program**.  
   Defines the __objects__ and __relationships__ for this particular diagram within the domain you selected.
 - A **Style** (.sty) program  
  This tells Penrose how to display the objects and relationships for the domain you selected. 

## Usually, you only need to write the Substance program ##

To create a new diagram, you simply create a short and simple Substance program that describes the domain objects and their relationships.  Often these are so short, you may not even realize you are writing a program.

The beauty of Penrose is you get to "stand atop giants."  Use the existing Style and Domain programs for many common domains.  You only need to modify a Style or Domain program if you want to add or change the way the domain is displayed (Style) or if you need to define new relationships or object types (Domain).

## Why write a program instead of dragging shapes around? ##

There are plenty of visual design tools.  While popular, these tools tend to lack composability, generality, and re-use.  Creators report spending a large amount of time moving shapes around trying to get everything "just right."  The more complex the diagram, the longer it taks to solve.  And for the next diagram, they get to do the same work all over again.  

It gets old fast and there is a better way!

Penrose already understands the diagram's domain and how to style the diagram.  You just define the objects and relationships.  Penrose goes to work by converting the three programs into an optimization problem that it solves using symbolic differentiation.  If you need to add a new shape, it's not a painstaking exercise -- Penrose automatically creates a new diagram that meets all of your constraints.

## Domain Language ##

These domains are supported "out of the box," but you can create your own, too.

## Substance Language

## Style Language ##

Style programs are primarily characterized by Shapes and Functions.  Shapes are graphical objects that are displayed on a canvas.  Examples are Circle, Rectangle, Line, Text, etc.  Functions are used by Style programs to express relationships among shapes and/or the canvas.  Penrose uses  

### Shapes ###

Shapes in a Style program represent graphical primitives that are rendered as output on a canvas.  For example, a circle, a rectangle, a line, and text are examples of these shapes.  Each shape has properties that may be set by the Style program, computed, or solved by Penrose using a constraint function.

### Functions ###

Functions in a Style program represent a computed constraint.  Etc.  Etc.
